There is an increasing interest in learning outside of the traditional classroom
setting, especially for instruction of computational tools and practices that
are challenging to incorporate in the standard curriculum. These atypical
learning environments offer new ways for teaching students skills and concepts,
particularly when it comes to combining conceptual knowledge with hands-on
methods. Advances in cloud computing and containerized environments provide an
attractive opportunity to improve the efficiency and ease with which students
can learn. This manuscript details recent advances towards using
commonly-available cloud computing services and advanced cyberinfrastructure
support for improving learning experiences in bootcamp-style events. We cover
the benefits (and challenges) of using a server hosted remotely instead of
relying on student laptops, discuss the technology that was used in order to
make this possible, and give suggestions for how others could implement and
improve upon this model for pedagogy and reproducibility.
